Python Hello World in Docker with VS Code Dev Container

This guide will walk you through creating a simple Python app that prints "Hello, World!" using Docker and VS Code Dev Containers.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Steps:

Step 1: Open VS Code
Launch Visual Studio Code on your machine.

Step 2: Create a `Dockerfile`
In the root of your project directory, create a new file named `Dockerfile` and add the following code:

dockerfile
Use the official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.12-slim

Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

Copy all files from the current directory to the container's working directory
COPY . /app

Command to run the app when the container starts
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Step 3: Create the Python App
Create a new file named `app.py` in the same directory and add the following code:

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

Step 4: Build the Docker Image
Open the terminal in VS Code and run the following command to build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <folder-name> .
```

- Replace `<folder-name>` with the name you want for your Docker image.
- The `.` refers to the current directory as the build context.

Step 5: Connect VS Code to a Remote Dev Container
Once your Docker image is built:
1. Click on the green button in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.
2. Select `Reopen in Container` from the dropdown.
3. This will open your project inside the Docker container.

Step 6: Run Your App Inside the Dev Container
Once connected to the Dev Container, open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```
Congratulations!
Your Python app is now running inside a Docker container using VS Code's Dev Containers! ðŸŽ‰
```
